This is known as [BadUSB attack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/this-thumbdrive-hacks-computers-badusb-exploit-makes-devices-turn-evil/), and it was the original purpose of [duckyScript and USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe).

But of course, it's up to you to decide what to do!
